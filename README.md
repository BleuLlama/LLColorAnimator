# LLColorAnimator

This is a simple class for Arduino + RGB Light strands that has
text-string sequence based animation frames.


# Arduino Sketch

In the LLColorAnimator_Demo directory, you'll find a project that 
initializes a bunch of animations, and works with a WS2801-based
LED string.  (This string has 4 wires between each LED... +5v,
Ground, Clock and Data.)
